## Projects
### My Work for Amnesty International
 
### Supervised Learning on Sleep Data
The american time use survey measures the use of time spent doing various activites throughout a 24 hour period.
My goal in this project was to create categories of sleep levels "Low, average, high" to then see if I can use 
the rest of the time use data to correctly categories these groups. I used 2018-29 data as a training set and used
the newest 2022 data as the test set going into the project in hopes of being able to use these models for future
years. Throughout the project I used various ensemble methods, tested with many different parameters to get optimal
scores. I also worked with Voting Classifiers which took into account Tree, kNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes models with 
optimized parameters

### NLP project

### Swim Team
One of the research projects I had the oppurtunity to be a part of was working with the Swim and Diving team here 
at Merrimack College. This was something that was worked on slowly throughout the year. The swimmers were tasked 
with filling out a survey weekly. I took this data and had to perform heavy data cleaning and wrangling to be able
to perform any type of analysis. A large portion of the time has been devouted to creating visualizations for the 
swimmers to view after recieving data. There has been dive into model building but hopes of more objective data in
the future has held us off on that for now. Current work involves constant updates to visuals, new visual ideas, and
automating the process from data recieved to visuals produced.
